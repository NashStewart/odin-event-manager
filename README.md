# Event Manager

This is my submission for the [Event Manager](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-event-manager) assigment from The Odin Project.

**This project does the following:**
- Manipulate file input and output.
- Read content from a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file.
- Transform it into a standardized format.
- Utilize the data to contact a remote service.
- Populate a template with user data.
- Manipulate strings.
- Access Googleâ€™s Civic Information API through the Google API Client Gem.
- Use ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating.

## Output
I have included the output directory which is created during the execution of `./lib/even_manager.rb`. 

This following is printed to console as well:
``` shell
Peak Registration Hours: {"13:00"=>3, "16:00"=>3, "19:00"=>2, "11:00"=>2, "21:00"=>2, "20:00"=>2, "10:00"=>1, "15:00"=>1, "17:00"=>1, "1:00"=>1, "18:00"=>1}
Peak Registration Days: {3=>7, 4=>5, 0=>4, 1=>2, 2=>1}
```
